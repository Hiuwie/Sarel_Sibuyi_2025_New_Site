                        <h2>Project Overview </h2>

                        <h3>Revolutionizing Internal Processes for Home Loans</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h4>Objective: </h4>
                    <p>To redesign and enhance an internal colleague platform, enabling faster and more efficient application 
                        capturing and processing. The goal was to empower internal users with multiples roles with an 
                        intuitive and robust tool to improve turnaround time and minimize errors throughout 
                        an application’s value chain.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Context:  </h4>
                    <p>The existing platform(Legacy) was outdated, slow, and lacked critical functionalities needed to 
                        support users effectively. This impacted our turnaround time in a market where clients 
                        got responses in 1-3days ours took about a week to two depending on the type of customer.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Misalignments between business stakeholders, designers, developers and all other stakeholders in the value chain.</li>
                    <li>Missed requirements, lack of accountability and different output times between discovery and delivery led to gaps in the final product.</li>
                    <li>The product under performed compared to its intended potential. </li>
                    <li>The users were hesitant to use the new platform so would quickly fall back to legacy  platforms</li>
                   </ul>

                        Engaged with MI DATA teams to understand what data they currently have and what data we could use to better understand why the colleagues where not using the new platform as intended.

                    <p>The nucleus project was started around 2018 and I only joined it in 2023 as a UX|UI designer. 
                        The Project was to build an internal colleague platform that would enable the Homeloans consultants 
                        to move from legacy into this new and better platform. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Improving TUT and workflow. Even though there was Salesforce an out of the box package, 
                        Salesforce didn’t have the necessary functions in 2018 when the project initially started. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        The project ran from 2018-*2025+ which is where I moved to another project due to lack of 
                        budget on Nucleus. Unfortunately the Nucleus numbers were not looking good and was not able 
                        to reach the target of 50% application capacity compared to legacy. By the time I left, Nucleus 
                        was still at *3 but was starting to gain some traction.

					<h3>"I learned a lot in a team of 3 primary designers.<br>One of the biggest projects I ever worked on"</h3>

				<p>This was one of the biggest projects I ever worked on. Very challenging with a dynamic team of complex 
                    individuals. Did my fair share of design thing and trying to come up with solutions. I got exposed to
                     PrimeNG which was the design framework used to build Nucleus. I think with a bit more collaboration, 
                     trust and accountability between the different teams (Design, DEVs, BAs, SAs, PAs, DATA and business ) 
                     the project could have gone a lot more smoother. But i was a great learning experience none the less and I’m 
                     able to take those learnings and apply them else were.
